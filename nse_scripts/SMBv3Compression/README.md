# SMBv3Compression Tester

NSE Script to check if a Windows machine has SMBv3 protocol enabled with the compression feature.
Currently it's a standalone NSE script with a patched lua file but we will PR the nmap repository with those changes.

## Supported CVEs

* No CVE has been published yet.

## Requirements

* nmap

## Usage
`cd` into run `SMBv3Compression` (your cwd must be the same as the files) and run:

    nmap -p445 --script ./smb2-capabilities_patched.nse IP_ADDR

Search for `SMBv3 Compression LZTN1 (Negotiation Context)`.
