# SMBv3 Compression Tester
NSE script to check if a Windows machine has SMBv3 protocol enabled with the compression feature. 

## Notes
Our NSE script is based on `smb2-capabilities.nse` which we expanded to detect SMBv3 compression as well. Currently it's a standalone NSE script with a patched lua file but we will PR the nmap repository with those changes.

## Example

    Starting Nmap 7.80SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-03-11 18:17 IST
